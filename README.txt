= About Proximic =

- Pattern Proximity Matching: 
Rather than traditional keyword density matching, Proximic uses proprietary Pattern Proximity Matching to interlink online media. While keyword density creates a match using 2-3 high frequency words, Pattern Proximity Matching can use 100s of patterns to return more relevant content. 

- Complex Content Matching Capabilities: 
When matching content, Proximic is able to incorporate many factors: location, time, price, description, and more. This means that Proximic can match highly qualified content with extremely targeted ads or information. 

- Proximic Platform Comparison: 
The Proximic platform is build with unrivaled scalability and flexibility. Because of this, Proximic is able to uniquely integrate with advertisers (some carrying more than 25 million listings) and distribute to the largest publishers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Please refer to the [Proximic Publisher Program FAQ](https://partners.proximic.com/faq "Frequently Asked Question") for general questions about the Proximic ad units.

= How do I implement a Proximic ad unit on my Wordpress blog? =

The Proximic ad unit code consist of a few JavaScript lines that enable our servers to scan your content, profile it appropriately and serve the best matching ads.

1/ Setup your ad units on the Proximic Publisher Program

To use the Proximic Ad Manager plugin, you must be registered and approved through the Proximic Publisher Program. If you do not have a Proximic publisher account yet, please register here first.
There, you can create ad units with format and colors matching you Wordpress blog and preview the contextually matching ads resulting from a URL query of your choice.
Once you are satisfied with your ad unit customization, copy the Proximic ad code provided.

2/ Manage and publish your ad units on your Wordpress account

Once you have installed and activated your Proximic Ad Manager plugin, a new link will appear under the "Posts" section of your Wordpress Admin page:
"Proximic Ads".
Click on this link and create your first Proximic ad unit by following the steps 1, 2 and 3:

- Step 1: Name your ad unit
This name will be used for calling the ad unit from your blog posts or templates. You can also add a description that will appear in your list of ad units.

- Step 2: Paste your Proximic ad code
Paste here the Proximic ad code you have previously copied from the Proximic Publisher Program.

- Step 3: Publish your ad unit
This gives you the corresponding code tags to use in your blog posts or template for publishing your Proximic ad units.

For templates, you can also go to Appearance > Widgets from your Wordpress Admin page and add the newly created Proximic widgets into your available template modules (header, sidebar...).

= When installing this plugin do I need to upload the entire directory? =

Yes, when installing the plugin it is recommended you upload the `/proximic-ad-manager/` directory.  Your directory structure should look something like this:

    - wp-content/
        - plugins/
            - akismet/
            - proximic/
                - license.txt
                - README.txt
                - proximic.php
                - proximic.js
                - proximic.css
                - screenshot-1.png
            - hello.php

= How do I stop the Proximic ad units from displaying on specific posts =

At any time you can disable or even delete the Proximic ad unit that you have created, and which code tag you have inserted in some blog post or template. This will have the immediate effect of stopping the display of this ad unit on the corresponding blog posts, pages or templates you referred it to.

= Why is my Proximic ad unit not showing? =

The Proximic ad units may not be showing on your website for the following reasons:

-  the Proximic ad code you copied/pasted is bad formatted

Make sure that the Proximic ad code that you copied from the Proximic Publisher Program has been pasted properly into your Proximic ad manager page in Wordpress. You should have a javascript code with the following format:
    <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">var proximic_widget_cl = { Publisher Customizations };</script>
    <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="http://widget.proximic.com/js/loader.js"></script>

- Website language

Currently, Proximic delivers ads only in English, German and Chinese language. If your website is written in another language, our system will not be able to deliver ads related to your website's content.

- User location

Currently, Proximic delivers ads for users located in the US, UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and China. Users located outside of these countries will not be able to see the Proximic ads from your website.

- Inappropriate content

Advertisers are reluctant to have their messages on pages about "adult content", violence or other "inappropriate content" defined in the section "Your Participation" within the Proximic Terms & Conditions, and these pages may be activating our filters. These filters work on a page-by-page basis, so if you think this may be an issue, look at pages that do not have sensitive content.

If you are still unable to determine why your ad units are not showing up on your website, please contact us [here](http://www.proximic.com/info/contact.php "contact")
